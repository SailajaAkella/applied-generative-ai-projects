        "\n",
        "*   Initially, I used the agent type **\"CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION\"**, which caused the chatbot to get stuck in an infinite loop and repeat the same reasoning steps. After trying different prompt changes and testing the flow, the issue was fixed when I replaced it with **\"STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION\"**. This type helped the chatbot respond properly without looping.\n",
        "######\n",
        "*   When users requested to **cancel an order**, the chatbot sometimes displayed raw database details instead of giving a clear message. I added a new logic to create simple, customer-friendly cancellation messages based on the order’s status.\n",
        "######\n",
        "*   If the customer’s query didn’t include an **Order ID**, the LLM tried to fetch all orders and kept repeating the same steps, leading to unnecessary looping. I added a check to detect if the Order ID was missing and made the chatbot ask the user to provide it instead.\n",
        "######\n",
        "*   Added **debug print statements** throughout the flow to make it easier to understand how the chatbot is processing each query. This helped track and fix problems quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Key Takeaways**\n",
        "\n",
        "*    In most scenarios, using **structured LLM guardrails** helps prevent unsafe or irrelevant responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Handling **user intent and missing order IDs** separately improved chatbot accuracy and reduced looping issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Providing clear, polite, and context-aware messages creates a **better customer experience**.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Using simple **print checks** during testing made it easier to find and fix problems quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Choosing tha **right agent type and fine-tuning prompts** had a big impact on chatbot performance and stability."
